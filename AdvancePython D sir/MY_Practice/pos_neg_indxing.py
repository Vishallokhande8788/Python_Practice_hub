Positive Indexing:
Element at index 0 (first element): apple
Element at index 1 (second element): banana
Element at index 4 (fifth element): elderberry

Negative Indexing:
Element at index -1 (last element): elderberry
Element at index -2 (second-to-last element): date
Element at index -4 (fourth-to-last element): banana

Positive and Negative Indexing with Slicing:
Elements from index 1 to 3 (positive indexing): ['banana', 'cherry', 'date']
Elements from index -4 to -2 (negative indexing): ['banana', 'cherry', 'date']

Accessing a Sublist Using Both Indexing Types:
Sublist from index 1 to the second-to-last: ['banana', 'cherry', 'date']
